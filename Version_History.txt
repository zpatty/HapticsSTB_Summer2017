V1.1 6/8/17
Features vastly improved documentation for the main codes as well as several variable name improvements to better match their purposes. Additionally, code was organized in folders to reduce clutter. Files that are no longer required to run the main tasks were moved to the Legacy folder, while the necessary ones were retained in the main folder.

V1.0 5/30/17
Version 1.0 represents the very starting point of this project. It 
encompasses all of the code, devices, and ideas as they were previously
created and passed on to us to continue. This is before any modifications.
